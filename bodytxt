Collection of additions to randomized weapon generation.

Currently features broadsword (tons), dagger, staff, and wand pieces by [USER=720151]tealsummernights[/USER]; spear, hammer, axe pieces by [USER=714236]ihcathb[/USER]; more to come.

He and I will be working to make this a successful community mod.
If you would like to contribute to the mod simply share in the discussion section:
  -your original assets
  -identify the weapon and part each represents
  -have the files in the proper format (refer to vanilla assets)
  -use the default color schemes so that color swaps work properly (refer to vanilla assets)
  -give each a unique identifier so we can track attributions easier (something like, IHART-dagger1b)
  -the license you use
  -how you want to be attributed

WHY ARE WE DOING IT THIS WAY
as it is the upper limit for variations of each part of a weapon can only be set once, because of this lots of little mods will really only run the one that loads last.
For this reason the best solution is to do it at once. Tealsummer and myself decided to team up to do this, and to open it up to all y'all.
